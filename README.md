The lore-webapp was developed at the [UQ ITEE eResearch Lab](http://itee.uq.edu.au/~eresearch) for the [HuNI (Humanities Networked Infrastructure)](http://huni.net.au/) project with funding from the [NeCTAR (National eResearch Collaborative Tools and Resources)](http://nectar.org.au/) program.

## About

The LORE webapp provides services for storing Open Annotation (OA) annotations and ORE Resource Map bodies and targets.

The source code for the lorestore gadget is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/uqsmcnau/lore-webapp/)

## Packaging

The web app can be configured via the constants.js file in webapp folder.

We use eclipse to import lorestore into the workspace as a Maven project (using eGit and m2eclipse).

Direct the browser to compound.html, to access funtionality.
